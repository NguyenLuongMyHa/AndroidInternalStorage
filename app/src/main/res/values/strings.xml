    <string name="internal_storage_description">When storing sensitive data—data that shouldn\'t be accessible from any other app—use internal storage, preferences, or a database. Internal storage has the added benefit of the data being hidden from users.
    \n Internal storage has limited space for app-specific data. Use other types of storage if you need to save a substantial amount of data.\nRef: https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage</string>
